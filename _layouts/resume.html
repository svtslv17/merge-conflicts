          <h2>My goals</h2>
          <p>My goal is to get a job in programming. I am interested in learning new technologies, so working in this area is a good idea! Since this area requires a good command of English, I can always improve my vocabulary, which in the future will help me in traveling around the world. I love traveling. A Junior Developer should always develop
             his programming and communication skills. Self-training is an integral part of the programmer.</p>
